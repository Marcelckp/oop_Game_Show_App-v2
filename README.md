# oop_Game_Show_App-v2

A JavaScript OOJS guessing game app, my fourth project.

click here to view/experience my project (unfinished) https://marcelckp.github.io/oop_Game_Show_App-v2/.

I added a button to my app that applies my CSS classes to turn the applications state into Dark Mode where
the on screen buttons, body, phrase header, and clickable buttons in the scoreboard div change to darker colors that have the correct contrast based on WCAG guide lines.

made changes to the phrase hunters main page body color.

I also added a button to the button of the scoreboard div where users can reset the game if they've made to many mistakes and wish to restart.
